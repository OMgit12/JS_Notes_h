// JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely supported across all major operating systems.

// Declare Variables in JavaScript
// In JavaScript, we use the "var" or "let" keywords to declare variables. For example,
var age;
let name;

// Initialize Variables in JavaScript
// declare variable num
let num;
// assign 5 to num
num = 5;

// JavaScript Constants
// A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
// assign 5 to num
const numbr = 5;

// assign 10 to num
numbr = 10;
console.log(numbr); // Error! constant cannot be changed
// Always Initialize a Constant During Declaration
